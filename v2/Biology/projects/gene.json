        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Bases:** Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, Cytosine (A, T, G, C)\n\n**2. Base pairing:**\n- A pairs with T (2 H-bonds)\n- G pairs with C (3 H-bonds)\n\n**3. Held together by:**\n- Hydrogen bonds between bases\n- Sugar-phosphate backbone"
        },
        "explanation": "**Chargaff's rules:** A=T and G=C. The double helix was discovered by Watson & Crick in 1953."

        },
        "explanation": "**Monohybrid cross** of heterozygotes gives 3:1 phenotype ratio. This was Mendel's key discovery."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Types:**\n- Point: Single nucleotide change\n- Chromosomal: Large DNA segment affected\n\n**2. Examples:**\n- Point: Sickle cell (A→T substitution)\n- Chromosomal: Down syndrome (extra chr. 21)\n\n**3. Frameshift:** Insertion/deletion shifts reading frame → all codons after are wrong"
        },
        "explanation": "**Mutations** can be neutral, harmful, or beneficial. Frameshift mutations usually have severe effects."

Cas9 mechanism:**\n- Guide RNA directs Cas9 to target DNA\n- Cas9 cuts both DNA strands\n- Cell repairs with new sequence\n\n**3. Applications:**\n- Gene therapy (cure genetic diseases)\n- Disease-resistant crops\n- Creating disease models"

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Semi-conservative:** Each new DNA molecule has one original strand and one new strand\n\n**2. Unwinds:** Helicase (breaks H-bonds)\n\n**3. Synthesizes:** DNA Polymerase (adds nucleotides 5'→3')"
        },
        "explanation": "**DNA replication** is extremely accurate (1 error per 10⁹ nucleotides) thanks to proofreading by DNA polymerase."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Cystic fibrosis** → Autosomal recessive (need 2 copies)\n\n**2. Huntington's disease** → Autosomal dominant (1 copy causes disease)\n\n**3. Hemophilia** → X-linked recessive (more common in males)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Inheritance patterns** determine disease risk. X-linked recessive affects males more because they have only one X chromosome."
