        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Spiral:** Disk with arms, ongoing star formation, young + old stars (Milky Way)\n\n**2. Elliptical:** Football-shaped, old stars, little gas/dust, no new star formation\n\n**3. Irregular:** No defined shape, chaotic, often from interactions (Magellanic Clouds)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Galaxy morphology** relates to history. Ellipticals may form from spiral mergers."

        "ques": "About the CMB:\n1. What is it?\n2. What temperature?\n3. Why is it important?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. CMB:** Afterglow radiation from 380,000 years after Big Bang\n\n**2. Temperature:** 2.725 K (very cold!)\n\n**3. Importance:**\n- Confirms Big Bang\n- Shows universe was once hot, dense\n- Tiny variations → seeds of galaxies"
        },
        "explanation": "**CMB** is the oldest light we can see. Before this, universe was opaque (too hot)."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Main idea:** Universe began from hot, dense state ~13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding\n\n**2. Evidence:**\n- CMB radiation\n- Redshift of galaxies (expansion)\n- Abundance of light elements (H, He)\n\n**3. First second:** Rapid inflation, cooling, quarks form protons/neutrons"
        },
        "explanation": "**Big Bang** was not an explosion INTO space - space itself expanded."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Dark matter:** Invisible matter that interacts only through gravity\n\n**2. Evidence:**\n- Galaxy rotation curves (too fast)\n- Gravitational lensing\n- Galaxy cluster dynamics\n\n**3. Candidates:** WIMPs, axions (unknown particles) - not normal matter"
        },
        "explanation": "**Dark matter** makes up ~27% of universe. We've never detected it directly."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Dark energy:** Unknown force causing universe expansion to accelerate\n\n**2. Discovery:** Type Ia supernovae fainter than expected → universe accelerating\n\n**3. Effect:** Universe will expand forever, eventually galaxies disappear from view"
        },
        "explanation": "**Dark energy** is ~68% of universe. Together with dark matter, 95% of universe is \"dark\"!"

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Hubble's Law:** v = H₀ × d\n(velocity = Hubble constant × distance)\n\n**2. Redshift:** Light stretched to longer wavelengths as source moves away\n\n**3. Shows expansion:** More distant galaxies have greater redshift → moving away faster → space expanding"
        },
        "explanation": "**Hubble's discovery** (1929) showed the universe is expanding. This led to Big Bang theory."
