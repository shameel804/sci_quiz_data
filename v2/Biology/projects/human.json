        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Stomach** → Protein digestion (pepsin + HCl)\n\n**2. Liver** → Produces bile (for fat digestion), detoxification\n\n**3. Small intestine** → Nutrient absorption (villi increase surface area)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Digestion** breaks down food mechanically and chemically. Most absorption occurs in the small intestine."

        "ques": "1. Trace blood flow through the heart\n2. Difference between arteries and veins\n3. What is blood pressure?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Blood flow:**\nBody → Right atrium → Right ventricle → Lungs → Left atrium → Left ventricle → Body\n\n**2. Comparison:**\n- Arteries: Away from heart, thick walls, high pressure\n- Veins: Toward heart, thin walls, valves\n\n**3. Blood pressure:** Force of blood on vessel walls (systolic/diastolic = 120/80 mmHg normal)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Double circulation:** Blood goes through heart twice per cycle (pulmonary + systemic)."

        "ques": "1. Where does gas exchange occur?\n2. What is diffusion?\n3. Why do we breathe faster during exercise?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Gas exchange:** Alveoli (thin walls, large surface area)\n\n**2. Diffusion:** O₂ moves from high→low concentration (alveoli→blood), CO₂ moves opposite\n\n**3. Exercise:** Muscles need more O₂ → more CO₂ produced → brain signals faster breathing"
        },
        "explanation": "**Alveoli** maximize surface area (~70 m²) for efficient gas exchange."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Neuron parts:**\n- Dendrites (receive signals)\n- Cell body (contains nucleus)\n- Axon (transmits signals)\n\n**2. Action potential:** Na⁺ rushes in (depolarization) → K⁺ rushes out (repolarization) → signal travels down axon\n\n**3. Neurotransmitters:** Chemicals that cross synapse to transmit signal (dopamine, serotonin)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Neurons** communicate electrochemically. Signals are electrical within neurons, chemical between neurons."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Insulin** → Pancreas (regulates blood sugar)\n\n**2. Adrenaline** → Adrenal glands (fight or flight response)\n\n**3. Thyroid hormone** → Thyroid gland (metabolism regulation)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Hormones** are chemical messengers. They travel in blood and affect target cells throughout body."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Antibodies:** Y-shaped proteins that bind specific antigens, marking pathogens for destruction\n\n**2. Vaccines:** Introduce weakened/dead pathogen → immune response → memory cells → future immunity\n\n**3. Cells:**\n- B cells: Make antibodies (humoral immunity)\n- T cells: Kill infected cells directly (cell-mediated)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Adaptive immunity** is specific and has memory. That's why you don't get same disease twice."
