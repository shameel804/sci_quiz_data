        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Factors:** Climate, organisms, relief (topography), parent material, time (CLORPT)\n\n**2. Horizons:**\n- O: Organic matter (leaf litter)\n- A: Topsoil (humus-rich, dark)\n- B: Subsoil (minerals accumulate)\n- C: Weathered parent material\n\n**3. Topsoil importance:** Contains nutrients, organic matter; supports plant growth"
        },
        "explanation": "**Soil formation** takes 500-1000 years per inch. Erosion can destroy it much faster."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Steps:**\nEvaporation → Condensation → Precipitation → Collection/Runoff\n\n**2. Transpiration:** Water released from plants through leaves (part of evaporation)\n\n**3. Freshwater distribution:**\n- Ice/glaciers: 69%\n- Groundwater: 30%\n- Surface water (lakes/rivers): <1%"
        },
        "explanation": "**Water cycle** moves water continuously. Only 3% of Earth's water is fresh, mostly frozen."

            "content": "**1. Tsunami causes:**\n- Undersea earthquakes (most common)\n- Volcanic eruptions\n- Landslides into water\n\n**2. Hurricane categories (Saffir-Simpson):**\n- Cat 1: 74-95 mph\n- Cat 5: >157 mph\n\n**3. Preparation:**\n- Emergency kit (water, food, flashlight)\n- Know evacuation routes\n- Secure property"
        },
        "explanation": "**Tsunamis** travel at 500+ mph in deep ocean. Early warning systems save lives."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Types:**\n- Water (rivers, rain)\n- Wind (desert areas)\n- Ice (glaciers)\n- Coastal (waves)\n\n**2. Grand Canyon:** Colorado River erosion over 5-6 million years\n\n**3. Prevention:**\n- Plant vegetation\n- Terracing\n- Retaining walls\n- Cover crops"
        },
        "explanation": "**Erosion** moves ~10 billion tons of sediment to oceans annually. Vegetation roots stabilize soil."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Deposition:** Settling of transported sediments when water/wind slows\n\n**2. Locations:**\n- River mouths (deltas)\n- Lake bottoms\n- Floodplains\n- Ocean floor\n\n**3. Delta formation:** River slows at ocean → drops sediment → builds up land (Mississippi, Nile)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Sedimentary processes** build new land and create fossil-bearing rock layers over time."
