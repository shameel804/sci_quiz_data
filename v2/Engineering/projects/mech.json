            "content": "**1. System types:**\n- Open: Mass and energy can cross boundary\n- Closed: Only energy crosses (fixed mass)\n- Isolated: Nothing crosses\n\n**2. State properties:** Fully defined by: Temperature, Pressure, Volume, Internal Energy, Enthalpy\n\n**3. Process types:**\n- Isothermal: Constant T\n- Isobaric: Constant P\n- Isochoric: Constant V\n- Adiabatic: No heat transfer"
