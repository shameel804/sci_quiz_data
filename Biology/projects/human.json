    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Pepsin"
    },
    "explanation": "***Pepsin*** is the main enzyme that breaks down proteins in the stomach.\nIt is secreted in an inactive form called ***pepsinogen***.\n```Pepsinogen``` is activated into pepsin by the acidic environment (low pH) of the stomach.\nOnce active, ***pepsin*** cleaves proteins into smaller peptides for further digestion in the small intestine."

    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Neurotransmitters are released to transmit signals."
    },
    "explanation": "At the synapse, an electrical signal reaches the ***axon terminal*** of the presynaptic neuron.\nThis triggers the release of ***neurotransmitters*** (e.g., acetylcholine, dopamine).\nThe neurotransmitters cross the ```synaptic cleft``` and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron.\nThis allows the signal to continue, either exciting or inhibiting the next neuron."
