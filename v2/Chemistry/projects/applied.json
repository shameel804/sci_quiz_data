        "ques": "For ammonia synthesis: N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃\n\n1. What conditions favor high yield?\n2. Why use 450°C despite Le Chatelier?\n3. What catalyst is used?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. High yield conditions:**\n- High pressure (200 atm) - fewer moles on right\n- Low temperature - exothermic reaction\n- Remove NH₃ as formed\n\n**2. 450°C used** for faster rate despite lower equilibrium yield (compromise)\n\n**3. Catalyst:** Iron with promoters (K₂O, Al₂O₃)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Haber process** balances yield vs rate. Too cold = high yield but too slow. Catalyst enables reasonable rate at lower temperature."

        "ques": "In electrolysis of molten NaCl:\n\n1. Write electrode reactions\n2. Why can't aqueous NaCl work the same way?\n3. What are the products of brine electrolysis?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Reactions:**\n- Cathode: Na⁺ + e⁻ → Na\n- Anode: 2Cl⁻ → Cl₂ + 2e⁻\n\n**2. Aqueous NaCl:** Water is reduced instead (H₂O → H₂ + OH⁻) because lower reduction potential\n\n**3. Brine products:** Cl₂, H₂, and NaOH (chlor-alkali process)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Electrolysis** splits compounds using electricity. In solution, the species with lowest reduction potential is reduced."

        "ques": "1. How is soap made (saponification)?\n2. Why doesn't soap work well in hard water?\n3. How do detergents differ?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Saponification:**\n```\nFat + NaOH → Glycerol + Soap\n(ester + base → alcohol + carboxylate salt)\n```\n\n**2. Hard water:** Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ form insoluble soap scum (calcium stearate)\n\n**3. Detergents:** Synthetic, don't precipitate with hard water (sulfonate groups)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Soaps** are sodium salts of fatty acids. Detergents have different ionic groups that stay soluble with Ca²⁺."

            "content": "**1. Definition:** At least one dimension 1-100 nm\n\n**2. Different properties because:**\n- Very high surface area to volume ratio\n- Quantum effects at small sizes\n- Different electronic structure\n\n**3. Applications:**\n- Drug delivery (penetrate cells)\n- Catalysis (high surface area)\n- Electronics (quantum dots)\n- Sunscreens (TiO₂ nanoparticles)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Nanomaterials** behave differently from bulk materials. Gold nanoparticles appear red, not gold-colored!"

        "ques": "For a zinc-copper cell:\n\n1. Write half-reactions\n2. Which is anode, which is cathode?\n3. Why does the zinc electrode get lighter?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Half-reactions:**\n- Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻ (oxidation)\n- Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu (reduction)\n\n**2.** Anode: Zinc (oxidation)\nCathode: Copper (reduction)\n\n**3. Zinc gets lighter** because Zn atoms dissolve into solution as Zn²⁺ ions"
        },
        "explanation": "**Galvanic cells** convert chemical energy to electrical. More reactive metal (Zn) is oxidized at anode."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Alloys:** Mixtures of metals; usually stronger than pure metals (different atom sizes disrupt slip)\n\n**2.** \n- Polymers: Long chains, flexible, low melting point\n- Ceramics: Ionic/covalent, hard, brittle, high mp\n\n**3. Steel stronger** because carbon atoms fit between iron atoms, preventing layers from sliding"
        },
        "explanation": "**Material properties** depend on structure. Impurities/alloying creates obstacles to dislocation movement → stronger material."
