        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Definition:** Heat from Earth's interior used for power/heating\n\n**2. Best locations:**\n- Volcanic regions (Iceland, New Zealand)\n- Plate boundaries\n- Hot spots\n\n**3. Pros/Cons:**\n- ✅ Renewable, low emissions, reliable\n- ❌ Location-specific, high upfront cost, potential subsidence"
        },
        "explanation": "**Iceland** generates 25% of electricity from geothermal. Earth's core is 5500°C."

        "ques": "1. Surface vs underground mining\n2. Environmental impacts\n3. Mine reclamation",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Types:**\n- Surface: Open pit, strip mining (removes overburden)\n- Underground: Shafts and tunnels (less surface disturbance)\n\n**2. Impacts:**\n- Habitat destruction\n- Water pollution (acid mine drainage)\n- Air pollution (dust)\n\n**3. Reclamation:** Restoring land after mining - fill, grade, replant"
        },
        "explanation": "**Mining** provides essential resources but requires careful environmental management."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Method:** Send vibrations into ground → measure reflected waves → map subsurface structures\n\n**2. Oil/gas:** Identify rock formations that may contain hydrocarbons; map reservoirs\n\n**3. Monitoring:** Earthquake early warning, volcanic activity, underground nuclear tests"
        },
        "explanation": "**Seismic imaging** reveals underground structures without drilling. Like ultrasound for Earth."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Artesian well:** Water under pressure rises without pumping (confined aquifer with recharge at higher elevation)\n\n**2. Recharge zone:** Area where water enters aquifer (protect from pollution!)\n\n**3. Sustainability:**\n- Match extraction to recharge rate\n- Protect recharge zones\n- Monitor water levels"
        },
        "explanation": "**Ogallala Aquifer** (US Great Plains) is being depleted faster than recharge - unsustainable."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Types:**\n- Gravity (massive concrete)\n- Arch (curved, transfers load to canyon walls)\n- Embankment (earth/rock fill)\n\n**2. Benefits:** Hydropower, flood control, water supply\n**Problems:** Ecosystem disruption, sediment trapping, displacement\n\n**3. Largest:** Three Gorges Dam, China (22,500 MW)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Dam removal** is increasing as costs outweigh benefits for aging dams."
