Population Inversion:\n- Normally, more atoms in ground state\n- Energy pumping puts more atoms in excited state\n- \"Inverted\" population needed for laser action\n\n### 2. Stimulated Emission:\n- Photon passes excited atom\n- Triggers release of identical photon\n- Same frequency, phase, and direction\n- Chain reaction in laser medium\n\n### 3. Optical Cavity:\n- Mirrors at both ends\n- Light bounces back and forth\n- Builds intensity\n- Partially transparent mirror lets beam out\n\n## Properties of Laser Light:\n\n| Property | Meaning |\n|----------|--------|\n| Monochromatic | Single wavelength (color) |\n| Coherent | All waves in phase |\n| Collimated | Parallel beam, low divergence |\n| High intensity | Energy concentrated |\n\n## Types of Lasers:\n\n| Type | Medium | Applications |\n|------|--------|-------------|\n| Helium-Neon | Gas | Pointers, alignment |\n| CO2 | Gas | Cutting, welding |\n| Ruby | Solid | First laser (1960) |\n| Semiconductor | Solid | Barcode readers, CDs |\n| Fiber | Optical fiber | Communications |\n\n## Applications:\n\n- Communications (fiber optics)\n- Manufacturing (cutting, welding)\n- Medicine (surgery, eye treatment)\n- Entertainment (shows, pointers)\n- Scientific research\n- Barcode scanners, CD/DVD/Blu-ray\n\n> **Fun Fact:** The first laser was demonstrated in 1960. Now even your phone likely contains several semiconductor lasers!"
