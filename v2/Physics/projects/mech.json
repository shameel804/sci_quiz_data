            "content": "### Definitions:\n\n1. **Displacement** - The shortest straight-line distance between the starting and ending positions, with direction. Unlike *distance*, it can be zero even if you moved.\n   - *Example:* Walking around a track and returning to the start = 0 displacement, but distance traveled = track length.\n\n2. **Velocity** - The rate of change of displacement with respect to time, including direction. Unlike *speed*, velocity can be negative.\n   - *Example:* A car moving east at 60 km/h has a velocity of 60 km/h east.\n\n3. **Acceleration** - The rate of change of velocity with respect to time. Unlike just \"change in speed,\" acceleration includes directional changes.\n   - *Example:* A car slowing down from 60 to 40 km/h in 2 seconds has acceleration = -10 km/h/s."
