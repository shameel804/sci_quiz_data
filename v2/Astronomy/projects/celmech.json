            "content": "**1 & 2. Elements:**\n- Semi-major axis (a): Size of orbit\n- Eccentricity (e): Shape (0 = circle)\n- Inclination (i): Tilt from reference plane\n- Longitude of ascending node (Ω): Where orbit crosses reference\n- Argument of periapsis (ω): Orientation of ellipse\n- True anomaly (ν): Position on orbit\n\n**3.** 6 elements fully describe orbit and position"

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Cause:** Differential gravitational pull (near side stronger than far side)\n\n**2. Two high tides:** Bulge on near side (stronger pull) AND far side (weaker pull, inertia)\n\n**3. Tidal locking:** Rotation synchronized with orbit (same face always toward partner) - Moon is tidally locked to Earth"

            "content": "**1. N-body problem:** Predicting motion of N gravitationally interacting bodies\n\n**2. Cannot solve exactly:** For N ≥ 3, no general analytical solution (chaos)\n\n**3. Methods:**\n- Numerical integration (computer simulations)\n- Perturbation theory (approximate)\n- Restricted 3-body (one mass negligible)"
