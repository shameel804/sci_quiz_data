            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Apollo 11** (1969) → First humans on Moon (Armstrong, Aldrin)\n\n**2. Voyager** (1977-) → Grand tour of outer planets, now in interstellar space\n\n**3. Hubble** (1990-) → Revolutionized astronomy with deep space images"
        },
        "explanation": "**Space exploration** transformed our understanding. Voyager 1 is the most distant human-made object."

        "title": "Telescope Types 🔭",
        "ques": "Compare:\n1. Optical vs radio telescopes\n2. Ground vs space telescopes\n3. Why use different wavelengths?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Optical vs Radio:**\n- Optical: Visible light, smaller\n- Radio: Radio waves, huge dishes (Arecibo, FAST)\n\n**2. Ground vs Space:**\n- Ground: Cheaper, larger, but atmosphere blurs\n- Space: No atmosphere, any wavelength\n\n**3. Different wavelengths:** Different phenomena emit different wavelengths (hot gas = X-ray, cold gas = radio)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Multi-wavelength astronomy** reveals hidden aspects. Infrared sees through dust; X-rays show high-energy events."

        "title": "Rocket Propulsion 🚀",
        "ques": "1. How do rockets work?\n2. What is escape velocity for Earth?\n3. Why stage rockets?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Mechanism:** Newton's 3rd law - exhaust pushed down, rocket pushed up (conservation of momentum)\n\n**2. Escape velocity:** 11.2 km/s (to leave Earth's gravity without further propulsion)\n\n**3. Staging:** Drop empty fuel tanks to reduce mass → more efficient (less mass to accelerate)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Rockets** are inefficient because they carry fuel's mass. That's why reaching orbit is so difficult."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Orbit:** ~400 km above Earth (Low Earth Orbit)\n\n**2. Countries:** 15 countries (USA, Russia, Japan, Canada, ESA members)\n\n**3. Research purposes:**\n- Microgravity experiments\n- Human health in space\n- Earth observation\n- Technology testing for deep space"
        },
        "explanation": "**ISS** orbits Earth every 90 minutes. It's continuously crewed since November 2000."
