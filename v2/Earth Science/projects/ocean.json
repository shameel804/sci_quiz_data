        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Surface currents:** Wind (primarily trade winds and westerlies)\n\n**2. Deep currents:** Thermohaline circulation (temperature and salinity differences)\n\n**3. Gulf Stream:** Warm current from Gulf of Mexico to Europe; keeps Western Europe mild"
        },
        "explanation": "**Ocean conveyor belt** circulates water globally over 1000 years. Critical for climate regulation."

        "ques": "1. Ocean zones by depth\n2. Where is most marine life?\n3. What is a coral reef?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Zones:**\n- Epipelagic (0-200m): Sunlit\n- Mesopelagic (200-1000m): Twilight\n- Bathypelagic (1000-4000m): Dark\n- Abyssopelagic (>4000m): Abyss\n\n**2. Most life:** Epipelagic zone (has light for photosynthesis)\n\n**3. Coral reef:** Structure built by coral polyps; \"rainforest of the sea\" - high biodiversity"
        },
        "explanation": "**Coral reefs** support 25% of marine species but cover <1% of ocean floor."

        "ques": "1. What causes tides?\n2. Spring vs neap tides\n3. How do waves form?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Tide causes:** Moon's gravity (mainly) + Sun's gravity\n\n**2. Types:**\n- Spring: Sun+Moon aligned, extreme high/low (full/new moon)\n- Neap: Sun+Moon at 90°, moderate tides (quarter moons)\n\n**3. Wave formation:** Wind transfers energy to water surface"
        },
        "explanation": "**Tides** are predictable (astronomical); **waves** depend on wind conditions."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Features:**\n- Continental shelf\n- Continental slope\n- Abyssal plain\n- Mid-ocean ridges\n- Trenches\n- Seamounts\n\n**2. Mid-ocean ridge:** Underwater mountain chain where new seafloor forms (divergent boundary)\n\n**3. Trench:** Deep valley where plate subducts (convergent boundary) - Mariana Trench deepest (11 km)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Seafloor spreading** at ridges creates new crust; subduction at trenches destroys old crust."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Sources of salt:**\n- River minerals washing to sea\n- Underwater volcanic vents\n- Weathered rock\n\n**2. Salinity:** ~35 ppt (parts per thousand) or 3.5%\n\n**3. Ocean acidification:** CO₂ dissolves → carbonic acid → pH drops; harms shell-forming organisms"
        },
        "explanation": "**Ocean pH** has dropped 0.1 since industrial era (30% more acidic). Threatens coral and shellfish."

            "content": "**1. El Niño:** Warming of eastern Pacific; weakened trade winds\n\n**2. La Niña:** Cooling of eastern Pacific; stronger trade winds\n\n**3. Effects:**\n- El Niño: Droughts in Australia, floods in South America\n- La Niña: More Atlantic hurricanes, colder winters in N. America"
        },
        "explanation": "**ENSO** (El Niño Southern Oscillation) affects global weather patterns every 2-7 years."
