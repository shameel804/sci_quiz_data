            "content": "### The Four Laws of Thermodynamics:\n\n**Zeroth Law:**\n- *Statement:* If A is in thermal equilibrium with B, and B with C, then A is in equilibrium with C.\n- *Example:* A thermometer reaches the same temperature as your body, and both reach equilibrium with the air.\n- *Implication:* Temperature is a well-defined, transitive property.\n\n**First Law (Conservation of Energy):**\n- *Statement:* Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.\n- *Example:* A car engine converts chemical energy (fuel) into kinetic energy and heat.\n- *Implication:* ΔU = Q - W (internal energy change = heat added - work done)\n\n**Second Law (Entropy):**\n- *Statement:* Heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold, never the reverse without work.\n- *Example:* Ice melts in warm water; water never spontaneously freezes in a warm room.\n- *Implication:* Entropy of an isolated system always increases.\n\n**Third Law:**\n- *Statement:* As temperature approaches absolute zero, entropy approaches a minimum.\n- *Example:* A perfect crystal at 0 K has exactly zero entropy.\n- *Implication:* Absolute zero (0 K) is unattainable in finite steps."

Three Modes of Heat Transfer:\n\n| Mode | Medium Required | Mechanism |\n|------|-----------------|----------|\n| **Conduction** | Solid (mainly) | Molecular vibrations & electron flow |\n| **Convection** | Fluid (liquid/gas) | Bulk fluid movement |\n| **Radiation** | None (works in vacuum) | Electromagnetic waves |\n\n### 2. Heat Transfer in Each Scenario:\n\n**Heat through metal rod:** → **Conduction**\n- Free electrons and lattice vibrations transfer energy atom-to-atom.\n\n**Heat radiating from fire:** → **Radiation**\n- Electromagnetic waves (infrared) travel outward; no medium needed.\n\n**Warm air rising:** → **Convection**\n- Hot air is less dense, rises; cooler air sinks (natural convection).\n\n### 3. Metal vs. Wooden Spoon:\n\n| Property | Metal | Wood |\n|----------|-------|------|\n| Thermal Conductivity | High (~200 W/m·K for steel) | Low (~0.1 W/m·K) |\n| Free Electrons | Many | None |\n| Result | Conducts heat rapidly | Insulates well |\n\nMetal spoons conduct heat quickly because of **free electrons** that rapidly transfer thermal energy."

The Hole gets BIGGER!** 🔴→⭕\n\nWhen heated:\n- Every part of the steel expands proportionally\n- Think of drawing a circle on a rubber sheet and stretching it\n- The entire disk scales up, including the hole\n- The hole expands as if it were made of the same material\n\n*This is why metal lids can be loosened by heating!*"
