        "ques": "Differentiate between a **food chain** and **food web**. Why are food webs more realistic?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Food Chain:**\n- Linear sequence: producer → consumer → consumer\n- Example: Grass → Rabbit → Fox\n\n**Food Web:**\n- Interconnected food chains\n- Shows multiple pathways\n- More realistic representation\n\n**Why webs are more realistic:**\n- Most organisms eat multiple food sources\n- Provides stability (one species loss doesn't crash system)\n- Shows indirect effects\n- Reflects actual ecosystem complexity"
        },
        "explanation": "Food webs show how energy flows through ecosystems. The more connections, the more resilient the ecosystem."

        "ques": "Explain the **10% rule** in ecology. Why are there fewer top predators than producers?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**10% Rule:**\nOnly ~10% of energy transfers to the next trophic level\n\n**Energy Loss (90%):**\n- Cellular respiration (heat)\n- Waste products\n- Uneaten parts\n- Movement/activity\n\n**Example:**\n```\n🌱 Producers: 10,000 kcal\n  🐛 Primary consumers: 1,000 kcal\n    🐦 Secondary consumers: 100 kcal\n      🦅 Tertiary consumers: 10 kcal\n```\n\n**Why few top predators:** Limited energy at top of pyramid"
        },
        "explanation": "This explains why food chains rarely exceed 4-5 levels—not enough energy. Also why eating plants is more efficient than eating meat."

        "ques": "Compare **primary** and **secondary** succession with examples.",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Primary Succession:**\n- Starts on bare substrate (no soil)\n- Example: Lava flow, glacial retreat\n- Pioneer species: lichens, mosses\n- Takes 100s-1000s of years\n\n**Secondary Succession:**\n- Starts where soil exists\n- Example: After fire, abandoned farm\n- Pioneer species: grasses, weeds\n- Faster (decades to century)\n\n**Climax Community:**\nFinal stable stage (forest, grassland depending on climate)"
        },
        "explanation": "Succession shows ecosystem recovery. Pioneer species modify environment, enabling later species to colonize."

        "ques": "Explain **nitrogen fixation** and why it's essential. What organisms can fix nitrogen?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Why Nitrogen Fixation is Essential:**\n- N₂ gas is 78% of atmosphere but unusable by most organisms\n- Plants need NH₄⁺ or NO₃⁻ for amino acids/proteins\n\n**Nitrogen-Fixing Organisms:**\n| Type | Example | Location |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| Free-living bacteria | *Azotobacter* | Soil |\n| Symbiotic bacteria | *Rhizobium* | Legume root nodules |\n| Cyanobacteria | *Anabaena* | Aquatic, symbiotic |\n\n**Process:** N₂ → NH₃ (using nitrogenase enzyme)\n\n**Haber process** does this industrially for fertilizers"
        },
        "explanation": "Nitrogen is often the limiting nutrient in ecosystems. Legumes with Rhizobium are used in crop rotation to enrich soil."

Polar Ice Loss:**\n- Polar bears losing sea ice habitat\n- Permafrost thaw releasing methane\n- Sea level rise threatening coastal ecosystems"
        },
        "explanation": "Species that can't adapt or migrate fast enough face extinction. Already seeing changes in flowering times, migration patterns."

        },
        "explanation": "Identifying and protecting keystone species is crucial for conservation. Their loss causes cascading effects throughout the ecosystem."

        },
        "explanation": "Real populations usually show logistic growth. Exceeding K leads to population crash. Humans have increased K through technology."
