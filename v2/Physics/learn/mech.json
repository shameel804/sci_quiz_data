It is the foundation of classical physics.\n\n## Key Areas\n- **Kinematics**: Describes motion without considering its causes (e.g., \"how fast?\")\n- **Dynamics**: Deals with the forces that cause motion (e.g., \"why does it move?\")\n- **Statics**: Studies bodies at rest on in equilibrium.\n\n> 💡 **Fun Fact:** Sir Isaac Newton laid the groundwork for classical mechanics in his work *Principia Mathematica* in 1687."

(Scalar quantity)\n- **Displacement ($\\Delta x$)**: The change in position. Vector (has direction).\n\n$$\\Delta x = x_f - x_i$$\nwhere $x_f$ is final position and $x_i$ is initial position.\n\n> 🚶 **Example:** If you walk 5m Forward and 2m Back:\n> - Distance = 5 + 2 = 7m\n> - Displacement = 5 - 2 = 3m Forward"
