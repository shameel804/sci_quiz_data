      "content": "Embryos of different animals show similar stages.\nThis suggests they share common developmental pathways.\nIt supports the idea of common ancestry."
    },
    "explanation": "Embryos of ***vertebrates share many features in early development***, such as ***pharyngeal slits and tails***.\nEven if these features are lost in later stages, their presence in embryos suggests ***a shared evolutionary origin***.\nThis is because ***similar genes and developmental patterns*** have been inherited from ***a common ancestor***.\nComparative embryology offers ***visible developmental evidence*** for evolutionary relationships."

    "title": "Allopatric Speciation Scenario",
    "ques": "A river splits a population of rodents. After thousands of years, they can no longer interbreed. What type of speciation has occurred?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "This is allopatric speciation.\nGeographic isolation prevented gene flow.\nEach population evolved separately into a new species."
    },
    "explanation": "When a ***physical barrier like a river*** separates a population, it causes ***geographic isolation***.\nThis leads to ***allopatric speciation***.\nWith no gene flow between the two groups, they undergo ***independent evolutionary changes*** due to mutation, selection, and drift.\nOver time, these differences become ***so significant*** that interbreeding is no longer possible.\nAt this point, ***two distinct species have formed***."

    "title": "Tool Use and Evolutionary Advantage",
    "ques": "How did tool use influence human evolution?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Tool use improved hunting and survival.\nIt led to selection for greater intelligence and coordination.\nThis influenced brain development and social behavior."
    },
    "explanation": "Early hominins who used tools had ***increased access to food and defense***, improving survival chances.\nThis advantage likely favored ***individuals with better cognitive and motor skills***.\nOver time, ***natural selection favored larger brains and complex thinking***.\nTool use also promoted ***social cooperation*** and ***cultural transmission***, accelerating ***both biological and cultural evolution*** in humans."
