        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Types:**\n- Body fossils (bones, shells)\n- Trace fossils (footprints, burrows)\n- Casts and molds\n- Frozen (mammoths)\n- Amber (insects)\n\n**2. Difference:**\n- Fossil: Preserved remains of organism\n- Trace: Evidence of activity (not body)\n\n**3. Formation:** Burial → minerals replace organic matter → rock forms around it"
        },
        "explanation": "**Fossilization** is rare - requires rapid burial. Most organisms decay without trace."

        "ques": "1. Relative vs absolute dating\n2. How does carbon-14 dating work?\n3. Why can't C-14 date dinosaurs?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Difference:**\n- Relative: Order of events (older/younger)\n- Absolute: Actual age in years\n\n**2. Carbon-14:** Living things absorb C-14. Death stops absorption. C-14 decays (half-life 5730 years). Less C-14 = older.\n\n**3. Dinosaurs:** C-14 half-life too short for >50,000 years. Use uranium or potassium dating for millions of years."
        },
        "explanation": "**Radiometric dating** uses decay rates. Different isotopes for different time scales."

            "content": "**1. Definition:** >75% of species disappear in short geological time\n\n**2. \"Big Five\":**\n- End Ordovician (445 mya)\n- Late Devonian (375 mya)\n- End Permian (252 mya) - worst, 96% gone\n- End Triassic (200 mya)\n- End Cretaceous (66 mya) - dinosaurs\n\n**3. Dinosaur extinction:** Asteroid impact (Chicxulub, Mexico) + volcanic eruptions"
        },
        "explanation": "**We may be in the 6th mass extinction** caused by human activity. Species loss rate 100-1000× normal."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Groups:**\n- Saurischia (lizard-hipped): T-rex, sauropods\n- Ornithischia (bird-hipped): Triceratops, Stegosaurus\n\n**2. Hip structure:** Different pubis bone orientation\n\n**3. Yes!** Birds are living dinosaurs (theropod descendants). \"Non-avian dinosaurs\" went extinct."
        },
        "explanation": "**Cladistics** shows birds ARE dinosaurs. Feathers evolved before flight for insulation."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Climate proxies:**\n- Ice cores (trapped air bubbles)\n- Tree rings\n- Coral growth\n- Fossils (palm trees in Arctic = warm)\n\n**2. Ice cores:** Cylinders drilled from ice sheets; contain trapped ancient atmosphere\n\n**3. Ice age evidence:**\n- Glacial landforms\n- Sea level changes\n- Oxygen isotope ratios"

        "explanation": "**Ice cores** from Antarctica go back 800,000 years. Show CO₂-temperature correlation."

        },
        "explanation": "**Geologic time** divided by major events (extinctions, appearances). Earth is 4.5 billion years old."
