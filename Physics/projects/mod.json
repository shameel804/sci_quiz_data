    "explanation": "***Step 1: Find Lorentz factor γ***\n```γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.95²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.9025) = 1 / √0.0975 ≈ 3.202```\n\n***Step 2: Time experienced by traveler***\n```Δt' = Δt / γ = 20 / 3.202 ≈ 6.25 years```\n\n***Step 3: Difference in aging***\n```20 - 6.25 = 13.75 years younger```\n\nSo, ***the traveling twin is 13.75 years younger.***"

      "type": "text",
      "content": "In reverse bias, only a tiny leakage current flows,\nas the potential barrier increases\nand majority carriers cannot cross the junction."
    },
    "explanation": "***Step 1: Reverse bias widens depletion layer***\n```Increases potential barrier.```\n\n***Step 2: Majority carriers are repelled***\n```They cannot cross the junction.```\n\n***Step 3: Only minority carriers contribute to leakage***\n```Resulting in very small reverse current.```\n\nSo, ***current is minimal in reverse bias.***"

    "ques": "Why does the conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor increase with temperature?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "As temperature increases,\nmore electrons gain enough energy\nto jump from the valence to conduction band,\nincreasing carrier concentration and conductivity."
    },
    "explanation": "***Step 1: Thermal energy excites electrons***\n```Electrons jump across the band gap.```\n\n***Step 2: Each excited electron leaves behind a hole***\n```Creates electron-hole pairs.```\n\n***Step 3: More charge carriers = higher conductivity***\n```Carrier concentration increases exponentially with temperature.```\n\nSo, ***conductivity rises with temperature.***"

    "ques": "Why does fusion release more energy per nucleon than fission?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "In fusion, light nuclei form a more stable nucleus\nwith higher binding energy per nucleon,\nreleasing greater energy per nucleon\nthan heavy nuclei splitting in fission."
    },
    "explanation": "***Step 1: Fusion forms stable nuclei***\n```Higher binding energy per nucleon = more stability.```\n\n***Step 2: Fission splits already large unstable nuclei***\n```Still releases energy, but less per nucleon.```\n\n***Step 3: Binding energy curve peaks near iron***\n```Fusion moves toward that peak more efficiently.```\n\nSo, ***fusion releases more energy per nucleon.***"
