            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Material:** Molecular cloud (hydrogen gas + dust)\n\n**2. Stages:**\n- Cloud collapses under gravity\n- Forms protostar (heats up)\n- Core reaches 10 million K\n- Fusion begins → main sequence star\n\n**3. Fusion begins:** When core temperature reaches ~10 million K (hydrogen → helium)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Protostars** take millions of years to form. Mass determines star's temperature, color, and lifespan."

            "content": "**1. Axes:**\n- X: Temperature (hot→cool, left→right)\n- Y: Luminosity (low→high, bottom→top)\n\n**2. Sun:** Middle of main sequence (G-type star)\n\n**3. Regions:**\n- Main sequence (diagonal band)\n- Red giants (upper right)\n- White dwarfs (lower left)\n- Supergiants (top)"

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Low-mass (< 8 M☉):**\nMain sequence → Red giant → Planetary nebula → White dwarf\n\n**2. High-mass (> 8 M☉):**\nMain sequence → Supergiant → Supernova → Neutron star or Black hole\n\n**3. Determining factor:** Mass (specifically, mass at end of life)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Mass is destiny** for stars. More massive = hotter, brighter, shorter life, more dramatic death."
