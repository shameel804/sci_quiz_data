        "ques": "Differentiate between:\n1. Primary and secondary pollutants\n2. Give 2 examples of each\n3. How is smog formed?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Primary:** Directly emitted (CO, SO₂)\n**Secondary:** Formed by reactions (O₃, PAN)\n\n**2. Examples:**\n- Primary: CO, NO, SO₂, particulates\n- Secondary: Ozone (O₃), H₂SO₄, PAN\n\n**3. Smog:** NOₓ + VOCs + sunlight → photochemical smog (contains O₃)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Secondary pollutants** form from primary pollutants reacting with sunlight/other chemicals. Ozone is good in stratosphere, bad at ground level."

        "title": "Greenhouse Effect 🌡️",
        "ques": "1. List 4 greenhouse gases\n2. Explain the greenhouse effect in 3 steps\n3. What is global warming potential (GWP)?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Greenhouse gases:** CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, CFCs\n\n**2. Greenhouse effect:**\n- Sunlight passes through atmosphere → heats Earth\n- Earth emits infrared radiation\n- GHGs absorb/re-emit IR → traps heat\n\n**3. GWP:** Compares warming effect to CO₂ (CO₂ = 1, CH₄ = 28, N₂O = 298)"
        },
        "explanation": "**GHGs** trap heat by absorbing infrared radiation. Without them, Earth would be -18°C. Too many → excess warming."

        "title": "Ozone Layer 🛡️",
        "ques": "1. How do CFCs destroy ozone?\n2. Write the reaction equations\n3. What replaced CFCs?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. CFC mechanism:** UV breaks C-Cl bond → Cl radicals destroy O₃ catalytically\n\n**2. Reactions:**\n```\nCFCl₃ + UV → CFCl₂ + Cl\nCl + O₃ → ClO + O₂\nClO + O → Cl + O₂\n```\nOne Cl destroys ~100,000 O₃!\n\n**3. Replacements:** HFCs (no chlorine), HCFCs (less harmful)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Montreal Protocol** (1987) banned CFCs. The ozone hole is slowly recovering thanks to this international action."

        "title": "Water Pollution 💧",
        "ques": "1. What is BOD and what does it indicate?\n2. Why does eutrophication cause fish death?\n3. List 3 water treatment methods",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand):** Amount of O₂ needed by microbes to decompose organic matter. High BOD = polluted water.\n\n**2. Eutrophication:** Excess nutrients → algal bloom → algae die → bacteria decompose → O₂ depleted → fish die\n\n**3. Treatment:**\n- Filtration/sedimentation\n- Chlorination/UV disinfection\n- Activated carbon adsorption"
        },
        "explanation": "**Clean water** has BOD < 5 mg/L. Eutrophication creates \"dead zones\" where aquatic life cannot survive."
    },

        "title": "Green Chemistry 🌿",
        "ques": "1. State 3 principles of green chemistry\n2. What is atom economy?\n3. Give an example of green solvents",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Principles:**\n- Prevent waste over treating\n- Use safer solvents\n- Design for energy efficiency\n\n**2. Atom economy:**\n```\n% Atom Economy = (MW product / MW all reactants) × 100\n```\nHigher = less waste\n\n**3. Green solvents:** Water, supercritical CO₂, ionic liquids"
        },
        "explanation": "**Green chemistry** designs processes that minimize hazardous substances. Prevention is better than cleanup."

        "ques": "1. What chemicals cause acid rain?\n2. Two environmental effects\n3. How is SO₂ emission reduced?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Causes:** SO₂ and NOₓ → H₂SO₄ and HNO₃ (pH < 5.6)\n\n**2. Effects:**\n- Damages buildings (dissolves limestone)\n- Kills fish (acidifies lakes)\n- Damages forests\n\n**3. SO₂ reduction:**\n- Scrubbers (limestone reaction)\n- Low-sulfur fuels\n- Flue gas desulfurization"
        },
        "explanation": "**Acid rain** has declined significantly since pollution controls. Normal rain is pH 5.6 due to dissolved CO₂."
