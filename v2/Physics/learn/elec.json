At $0.15/kWh, that bulb costs $0.15 for 10 hours."

            "content": "# Kirchhoff's Laws\n\nKirchhoff's laws are essential for analyzing complex circuits.\n\n## Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):\n\n> **\"The sum of currents entering a node equals the sum leaving.\"**\n\n```\nSum of I_in = Sum of I_out\n```\n\n### Principle:\n- Based on charge conservation\n- Current cannot accumulate at a point\n- What goes in must come out\n\n## Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):\n\n> **\"The sum of all voltages around any closed loop is zero.\"**\n\n```\nSum of V_loop = 0\n```\n\n### Principle:\n- Based on energy conservation\n- Energy gained = Energy lost in a loop\n- Voltage rises - Voltage drops = 0\n\n## Applying KVL:\n\n1. Choose a direction around the loop\n2. Voltage RISES are positive (going through battery - to +)\n3. Voltage DROPS are negative (going through resistor with current)\n\n## Example Circuit:\n\nBattery (12 V) connected to two resistors (4 ohm and 2 ohm) in series.\n\n**Find current:**\n```\nUsing KVL:\n12 V - 4I - 2I = 0\n12 = 6I\nI = 2 A\n```\n\n## Sign Conventions:\n\n| Element | Traversing with current | Traversing against current |\n|---------|------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Resistor | -IR (drop) | +IR (rise) |\n| Battery (+ to -) | +V (rise) | -V (drop) |\n\n> **Problem Solving:** For complex circuits, write KCL for each node and KVL for each loop. You'll get enough equations to solve for all unknowns!"
