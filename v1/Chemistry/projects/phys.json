    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "It is the unique temperature and pressure where solid, liquid, and gas coexist in equilibrium."
    },
    "explanation": "On a ***phase diagram***, the ***triple point*** is where ***all three phases meet***.\nAt this point:\n- Solid, liquid, and gas are in ***equilibrium***\n- No net change in phase occurs\n```It’s a fixed point for every substance, used in calibrating thermometers.```"

    "title": "Effect of Catalyst on Equilibrium Constant",
    "ques": "Does a catalyst affect the equilibrium constant (K) of a reversible reaction?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "No, it does not affect the equilibrium constant."
    },
    "explanation": "***Catalysts*** lower the ***activation energy*** for both forward and reverse reactions ***equally***.\nThis speeds up the rate of reaching equilibrium ***but does not change concentrations at equilibrium***.\n```So, the value of K remains unchanged.```"
