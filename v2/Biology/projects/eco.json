        "ques": "1. What is the difference between food chain and food web?\n2. What are trophic levels?\n3. Why is energy transfer only ~10% efficient?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1.** Food chain: Single linear pathway. Food web: Interconnected food chains\n\n**2. Trophic levels:**\n1. Producers (plants)\n2. Primary consumers (herbivores)\n3. Secondary consumers (carnivores)\n4. Tertiary consumers (top predators)\n\n**3. Only ~10%** because energy lost as heat (metabolism), waste, uneaten parts"
        },
        "explanation": "**10% rule** means top predators need large areas. That's why there are fewer lions than zebras."

        "title": "Biomes 🌍",
        "ques": "Match climate to biome:\n1. Hot and dry year-round\n2. Cold with permafrost\n3. High rainfall, high biodiversity",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Hot and dry** → Desert\n\n**2. Cold with permafrost** → Tundra\n\n**3. High rainfall, biodiversity** → Tropical rainforest"
        },
        "explanation": "**Biomes** are determined by temperature and precipitation. Latitude and altitude both affect climate."

        "title": "Biodiversity Measurement 📊",
        "ques": "1. What is species richness?\n2. What is species evenness?\n3. Why is biodiversity important?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Richness:** Number of different species\n\n**2. Evenness:** How equally abundant each species is\n\n**3. Importance:**\n- Ecosystem stability\n- Food sources\n- Medicines\n- Ecosystem services (pollination, water purification)"
        },
        "explanation": "**High biodiversity** makes ecosystems more resilient to disturbances."
    },

        "title": "Ecological Succession 🌱",
        "ques": "1. What is primary vs secondary succession?\n2. What is a climax community?\n3. Example of pioneer species",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Types:**\n- Primary: Starts from bare rock (no soil)\n- Secondary: After disturbance (fire/flood), soil remains\n\n**2. Climax community:** Stable, mature ecosystem that doesn't change unless disturbed\n\n**3. Pioneer species:** Lichens, mosses (break down rock, create soil)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Succession** is predictable change in community composition over time. Secondary is faster because soil exists."
    },

        "title": "Carbon Cycle ♻️",
        "ques": "1. How does carbon enter atmosphere?\n2. How is it removed?\n3. What is a carbon sink?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Enters atmosphere:**\n- Respiration\n- Combustion (burning fossil fuels)\n- Decomposition\n\n**2. Removed by:**\n- Photosynthesis\n- Ocean absorption\n\n**3. Carbon sink:** Reservoir that absorbs more carbon than it releases (forests, oceans)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Carbon cycle** is disrupted by fossil fuel burning, releasing ancient carbon faster than sinks can absorb."
    },

        "title": "Climate Change Impacts 🌡️",
        "ques": "1. Three effects of climate change on ecosystems\n2. What is coral bleaching?\n3. How can species respond?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Effects:**\n- Shifting habitats (species move poleward)\n- Timing changes (earlier spring)\n- Extinctions (can't adapt fast enough)\n\n**2. Coral bleaching:** Stressed corals expel symbiotic algae → turn white → may die\n\n**3. Responses:** Migrate, adapt, or go extinct"
        },
        "explanation": "**Climate change** is happening faster than many species can adapt or migrate."
