Interference pattern changes\n\n## First Detection (2015):\n\n- Two black holes merging\n- 36 and 29 solar masses\n- 1.3 billion light-years away\n- Signal lasted 0.2 seconds\n- Nobel Prize 2017\n\n## What We Learn:\n\n| Discovery | Significance |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| Black hole mergers | Proves they exist in pairs |\n| Neutron star mergers | Origin of heavy elements |\n| Speed of gravity | Equals speed of light |\n| General Relativity | Confirmed again |\n\n## Future Detection:\n\n- LISA (space-based interferometer)\n- Einstein Telescope (next-generation ground)\n- Pulsar timing arrays (very low frequency)\n\n> **New Astronomy:** Gravitational waves opened a new window on the universe - we can now \"hear\" events invisible to light!"
