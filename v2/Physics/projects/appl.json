        "ques": "A lever has the fulcrum **0.5 m** from the load and **2.0 m** from the effort.\n\n1. What is the mechanical advantage?\n2. If you apply 100 N of force, what load can you lift?\n3. Identify the class of this lever and give an example",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Mechanical Advantage:**\n```\nMA = Effort arm / Load arm\nMA = 2.0 / 0.5 = 4\n```\n\n**2. Load lifted:**\n```\nLoad = Effort × MA = 100 × 4 = 400 N\n```\n\n**3. Class:** First-class lever (fulcrum between load and effort)\n*Examples:* Seesaw, crowbar, scissors"
