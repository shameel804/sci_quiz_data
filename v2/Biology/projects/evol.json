            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Four Conditions for Natural Selection:**\n\n1. **Variation:** Individuals differ in traits\n\n2. **Heritability:** Traits are passed to offspring\n\n3. **Differential Reproduction:** Some variants survive/reproduce better\n\n4. **Overproduction:** More offspring than can survive\n\n**Result:** Beneficial traits become more common over generations\n\n*Example:* Peppered moths during Industrial Revolution—dark moths survived better on soot-covered trees"

            "content": "**1. Fossil Record:**\n- Shows transitional forms\n- *Example:* Archaeopteryx (dinosaur→bird features)\n\n**2. Homologous Structures:**\n- Similar anatomy, different functions\n- *Example:* Whale flipper, bat wing, human arm—same bones\n\n**3. Molecular Evidence:**\n- DNA/protein similarities reflect ancestry\n- *Example:* Humans share 98.7% DNA with chimps\n\n**Also:**\n- Vestigial structures (human appendix)\n- Biogeography (island species)"

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Allopatric Speciation:**\n- Geographic barrier separates populations\n- Populations evolve independently\n- *Example:* Grand Canyon squirrels—Kaibab and Abert squirrels diverged\n\n**Sympatric Speciation:**\n- No geographic barrier\n- Reproductive isolation develops within same area\n- *Example:* Apple maggot flies—some shifted from hawthorn to apple trees\n\n**Key to Both:** Reproductive isolation prevents gene flow → populations diverge"
        },
        "explanation": "Allopatric is more common. Sympatric often involves polyploidy in plants or behavioral/temporal isolation."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Genetic Drift:**\nRandom changes in allele frequencies, especially in small populations\n\n**Bottleneck Effect:**\n- Population drastically reduced (disaster, hunting)\n- Survivors may not represent original gene pool\n- *Example:* Cheetahs—nearly identical genetically\n\n**Founder Effect:**\n- Small group colonizes new area\n- Carries subset of alleles\n- *Example:* Amish—high frequency of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome\n\n**Key:** Random, not adaptive—can reduce genetic diversity"
        },
        "explanation": "Drift is stronger in small populations. Can lead to fixation or loss of alleles regardless of fitness."
