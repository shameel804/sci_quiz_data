            "content": "**1. ML:** Computers learn patterns from data without explicit programming\n\n**2. Types:**\n- Supervised: Labeled data (input→output pairs)\n- Unsupervised: No labels, find patterns\n\n**3. Model:** Mathematical representation that makes predictions based on learned patterns"

            "content": "**1. Neural network:** Computing system inspired by biological neurons; interconnected nodes process data\n\n**2. Layer:** Group of neurons at same depth\n- Input layer (receives data)\n- Hidden layers (process)\n- Output layer (predictions)\n\n**3. Activation function:** Introduces non-linearity (ReLU, sigmoid); decides if neuron \"fires\""
