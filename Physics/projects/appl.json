    },
    "explanation": "***Second-class levers*** have the ***load*** positioned between the ***fulcrum*** and the ***effort***.\nIn a wheelbarrow:\n```Fulcrum``` = the wheel,\n```Load``` = contents of the wheelbarrow,\n```Effort``` = applied at the handles.\nThis setup fits the second-class lever characteristics."

      "type": "text",
      "content": "The mechanical advantage is 4."
    },
    "explanation": "In an ideal pulley system, ***mechanical advantage (MA)*** is equal to the number of supporting ropes.\nHere, 4 ropes support the load.\nSo, MA = ***4***.\nThis means the force needed to lift the object is ***one-fourth*** of the weight of the load."

    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Airplane wings are designed so that air flows faster over the top surface, creating lower pressure above the wing and higher pressure below, resulting in lift."
    },
    "explanation": "***Bernoulli's principle*** states that an ***increase in fluid speed*** results in a ***decrease in pressure***.\nAirplane wings are curved on top:\n- Air moves faster over the curved top\n- Slower under the flat bottom\nAccording to Bernoulli:\n```Higher speed = lower pressure```\nSo, pressure is ***lower above*** and ***higher below***, creating an upward ***lift force***."

    },
    "explanation": "According to ***Bernoulli’s principle***:\nIf fluid flows through a constricted section:\n- ***Speed increases*** (due to conservation of mass)\n- ***Pressure decreases***\nSo, as water enters the narrower part:\n```Velocity↑``` → ```Pressure↓```"

    },
    "explanation": "***Escape velocity*** is the speed needed to break free from a gravitational field.\nFor black holes, gravity is so strong that:\n```Escape velocity > speed of light (c)```\nSince nothing can move faster than light, ***nothing can escape***, not even light itself.\nThis defines the ***event horizon*** of a black hole."

    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "A force of 33.33 N is required to balance the lever."
    },
    "explanation": "***Lever principle***: torque on both sides must be equal to balance.\n```Torque = Force × Distance from fulcrum```\nLeft side: 100 N × 0.5 m = 50 Nm\nRight side: Let force be F, distance = 1.5 m → F × 1.5 m = 50 Nm\nSo, F = 50 / 1.5 = ***33.33 N***"

    },
    "explanation": "In a ***fixed pulley***:\n- ***MA = 1*** → force equals the weight\n- If the object is lifted 2 meters:\n```Work = Force × Distance = 200 N × 2 m = 400 J```\nThis system ***changes direction*** of force but not the magnitude."

    },
    "explanation": "***Bernoulli's principle*** applies here:\n- Wind blows over the chimney top → ***higher airspeed***\n- Higher speed → ***lower pressure*** at the top\n- Creates a pressure difference: ```lower at top, higher inside chimney```\n- This pressure difference ***pulls the smoke upward***"

    },
    "explanation": "***Continuity equation***: Flow rate must remain constant.\nNarrow section → smaller area → velocity increases\nBy ***Bernoulli's principle***:\n```Higher velocity = Lower pressure```\nSo, ***pressure drops*** in the narrow region, known as the ***Venturi effect***"

      "content": "The load is distributed across 4 rope segments, giving a mechanical advantage of 4, so only 100 N of effort is needed."
    },
    "explanation": "In a ***compound pulley*** system:\n```MA = number of supporting rope segments```\nHere, 2 fixed + 2 movable = 4 segments supporting the load → MA = 4\nEffort = Load / MA = 400 N / 4 = ***100 N***\nSo, the system multiplies the applied force by 4."

    },
    "explanation": "***Bernoulli’s principle*** explains this:\n- Spinning ball → one side moves with airflow (faster), other side against it (slower)\n```Faster air = lower pressure, Slower air = higher pressure```\nThis pressure difference creates a ***side force*** → the ball curves.\nThis is called the ***Magnus effect***."
