            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Step-by-step mechanism:**\n\n1. **Solar radiation** (visible light) passes through atmosphere\n2. Earth's surface absorbs light, warms up\n3. Earth re-emits **infrared radiation** (heat)\n4. **CO₂ molecules absorb IR** at specific wavelengths\n5. CO₂ vibrates (bending, stretching modes)\n6. CO₂ **re-emits IR in all directions**\n7. Some IR returns to Earth → **warming**\n\n**Key:** CO₂ is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared"
