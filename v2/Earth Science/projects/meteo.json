        "ques": "1. Define cold front and warm front\n2. Weather associated with each\n3. How are they shown on maps?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Definitions:**\n- Cold front: Cold air mass pushes under warm air\n- Warm front: Warm air mass slides over cold air\n\n**2. Weather:**\n- Cold front: Sharp drop in temp, heavy rain, thunderstorms\n- Warm front: Gradual warming, light rain, clouds\n\n**3. Map symbols:**\n- Cold: Blue line with triangles\n- Warm: Red line with semicircles"
        },
        "explanation": "**Fronts** are boundaries between air masses. Cold fronts move faster, causing more dramatic weather."

        "title": "Climate Zones 🌍",
        "ques": "1. What determines climate zones?\n2. Name the main climate zones\n3. Difference between weather and climate",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Factors:**\n- Latitude (solar angle)\n- Altitude\n- Ocean currents\n- Distance from water\n\n**2. Zones:**\n- Tropical, Subtropical, Temperate, Polar\n\n**3. Difference:**\n- Weather: Short-term, daily conditions\n- Climate: Long-term average patterns (30+ years)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Climate** is \"average weather.\" Latitude is primary factor - poles receive less solar energy."

        "ques": "1. List atmosphere layers from surface up\n2. Where is ozone layer?\n3. Where does weather occur?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Layers (bottom to top):**\n- Troposphere (0-12 km)\n- Stratosphere (12-50 km)\n- Mesosphere (50-85 km)\n- Thermosphere (85-600 km)\n- Exosphere (600+ km)\n\n**2. Ozone:** Stratosphere (protects from UV)\n\n**3. Weather:** Troposphere (all clouds, rain here)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Troposphere** contains 80% of atmosphere's mass. Temperature drops ~6.5°C per km altitude."

        "ques": "1. Tools used in weather forecasting\n2. What is a weather satellite?\n3. Why is forecasting limited?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Tools:**\n- Barometer (pressure)\n- Thermometer (temperature)\n- Anemometer (wind speed)\n- Radar (precipitation)\n- Satellites (clouds, movement)\n\n**2. Weather satellites:** Observe Earth from space; track storms, cloud patterns\n\n**3. Limitations:**\n- Atmosphere is chaotic system\n- Small errors grow exponentially\n- ~10 day forecast limit"
        },
        "explanation": "**Chaos theory** limits long-range forecasts. The \"butterfly effect\" makes weather inherently unpredictable."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Hurricanes:**\n- Form over warm ocean (>26°C)\n- Warm, moist air rises, creates low pressure\n- Coriolis effect causes rotation\n- Safety: Evacuate coast, board windows\n\n**2. Tornadoes:**\n- Form from supercell thunderstorms\n- Wind shear creates rotation\n- Safety: Underground/interior room\n\n**3. Key difference:** Hurricanes = large, slow; Tornadoes = small, intense"
        },
        "explanation": "**Hurricanes** lose strength over land (no warm water). Tornadoes last minutes; hurricanes last days."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1 & 2. Systems:**\n- High pressure: Sinking air, clear skies, stable\n- Low pressure: Rising air, clouds, storms\n\n**3. Wind flow (Northern Hemisphere):**\n- High: Clockwise, outward\n- Low: Counter-clockwise, inward\n\n(Opposite in Southern Hemisphere)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Pressure differences** drive wind. Air moves from high to low pressure, deflected by Coriolis effect."
