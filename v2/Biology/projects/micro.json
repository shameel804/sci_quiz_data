        "ques": "1. What shapes can bacteria be?\n2. Are bacteria prokaryotic or eukaryotic?\n3. How do bacteria reproduce?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Shapes:**\n- Cocci (spherical)\n- Bacilli (rod-shaped)\n- Spirilla (spiral)\n\n**2. Prokaryotic** (no nucleus or membrane-bound organelles)\n\n**3. Binary fission:** DNA replicates → cell divides → 2 identical cells"
        },
        "explanation": "**Bacteria** reproduce very fast (every 20 minutes). That's why infections spread quickly."

        "title": "Virus Structure 🔬",
        "ques": "1. Is a virus alive?\n2. Basic virus structure\n3. Lytic vs lysogenic cycle",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Not alive:** Cannot reproduce without host cell\n\n**2. Structure:**\n- Genetic material (DNA or RNA)\n- Protein coat (capsid)\n- Some have envelope\n\n**3. Cycles:**\n- Lytic: Virus reproduces, destroys cell\n- Lysogenic: Virus DNA integrates, lies dormant"
        },
        "explanation": "**Viruses** are on the edge of life. They need host cells to replicate."

        "ques": "1. What is fermentation?\n2. Two types and products\n3. Industrial applications",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Fermentation:** Anaerobic respiration (no oxygen)\n\n**2. Types:**\n- Alcoholic: Glucose → Ethanol + CO₂ (yeast)\n- Lactic acid: Glucose → Lactic acid (muscles, yogurt)\n\n**3. Applications:**\n- Beer/wine (alcohol)\n- Bread (CO₂ for rising)\n- Yogurt/cheese (lactic acid)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Fermentation** produces less ATP than aerobic respiration but works without oxygen."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Mechanism:** Target bacterial structures (cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis)\n\n**2. Not effective on viruses:** Viruses lack cell walls and ribosomes that antibiotics target\n\n**3. Resistance:** Bacteria evolve to survive antibiotics (overuse accelerates this)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Antibiotic resistance** is a global health threat. Complete your prescribed course!"

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. GMOs:** Organisms with DNA modified using biotechnology\n\n**2. Insulin production:** Human insulin gene inserted into bacteria → bacteria produce insulin\n\n**3. Benefits:** Disease-resistant crops, medicine production\n**Concerns:** Unknown long-term effects, corporate control of seeds"
        },
        "explanation": "**Genetic engineering** uses restriction enzymes and plasmids to insert genes into organisms."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Stem cells:** Undifferentiated cells that can become specialized cells\n\n**2. Types:**\n- Embryonic: Can become any cell type (pluripotent)\n- Adult: More limited differentiation\n\n**3. Applications:**\n- Organ regeneration\n- Disease treatment\n- Drug testing"
        },
        "explanation": "**Stem cells** offer hope for treating currently incurable diseases but raise ethical concerns."
