Law of Periods:**\n$$T^2 ∝ a^3$$\nOrbital period squared proportional to semi-major axis cubed\n\n*Example:* Earth (1 AU, 1 yr) vs Jupiter (5.2 AU, 11.86 yr)\n5.2³ ≈ 140.6, √140.6 ≈ 11.86 ✓"

        "explanation": "Moon's gravity varies with distance (1/r²). The differential creates the tide-generating force."
