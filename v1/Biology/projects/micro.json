    "ques": "Explain three major differences between bacteria and viruses in terms of structure, reproduction, and treatment.",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "1. Bacteria are single-celled organisms with a cell wall, while viruses are non-cellular and consist of genetic material in a protein coat.\n2. Bacteria reproduce independently through binary fission, but viruses require a host cell to replicate.\n3. Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics, whereas viral infections require antivirals or vaccines."
    },
    "explanation": "***1. Structure***: \n```Bacteria``` have a complete cellular structure, including a cell wall and cytoplasm. \n```Viruses``` are much simpler, made up of DNA or RNA enclosed in a protein coat, with no cell structures.\n\n***2. Reproduction***: \n```Bacteria``` reproduce on their own by binary fission. \n```Viruses``` cannot reproduce unless they infect a host cell and hijack its machinery.\n\n***3. Treatment***: \n```Antibiotics``` kill or inhibit bacteria, but they don't work on viruses. \n```Viruses``` are managed through antivirals or vaccines to prevent infection."

    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Yeast is a microorganism that ferments sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. In baking, the CO2 causes dough to rise, while in brewing, alcohol is produced during fermentation."
    },
    "explanation": "***Fermentation*** is an anaerobic process in which \n```yeast breaks down sugars``` like glucose.\n\nIn ***baking***: \nYeast converts sugar into carbon dioxide, forming bubbles in the dough. This makes the dough rise and gives bread its soft texture.\n\nIn ***brewing***: \nYeast converts sugar into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide. This process is essential in making beer and wine."

    "title": "Use of Antibiotics",
    "ques": "What are antibiotics, and why don't they work on viral infections?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Antibiotics are drugs that kill or stop the growth of bacteria. They are ineffective against viruses because viruses do not have the structures that antibiotics target, such as cell walls or metabolic pathways."
    },
    "explanation": "***Antibiotics*** work by targeting specific features of bacteria such as the cell wall, protein synthesis machinery, or metabolic enzymes.\n\n```Viruses``` lack these features â€” they don't have a cell wall or metabolism. Instead, they hijack host cells to reproduce.\n\nSo, antibiotics cannot interfere with viral replication, making them ***ineffective against viruses***."

      "content": "Antibiotic resistance is when bacteria evolve to survive exposure to antibiotics. It develops through random mutations and overuse or misuse of antibiotics, which select for resistant strains."
    },
    "explanation": "***Antibiotic resistance*** occurs when bacteria change in ways that reduce or eliminate the effectiveness of drugs.\n\n***How it develops***:\n- Mutations may randomly give some bacteria resistance.\n- When antibiotics are overused, they kill non-resistant bacteria, leaving behind the resistant ones to multiply.\n- This creates a population of ```resistant bacteria``` that no longer respond to standard treatments."

    },
    "explanation": "***Golden Rice*** contains genes from daffodils and a bacterium that enable it to produce ```beta-carotene``` in the grain.\n\nThis helps address vitamin A deficiency in populations that rely heavily on rice.\n\nItâ€™s a GMO because foreign genes were ***inserted*** into its genome using ***genetic engineering*** tools."

    "title": "Ethical Concern in Cloning",
    "ques": "Mention one ethical concern associated with human cloning.",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "One ethical concern is the potential loss of individuality and the psychological impact on the cloned person knowing they are a copy of someone else."
    },
    "explanation": "Cloning a human could raise ***identity and autonomy*** issues.\n\nA clone might struggle with the idea of being a genetic duplicate and feel pressure to live up to the originalâ€™s life.\n\nThere are also concerns about the use of embryos and the ***potential misuse*** of cloning for non-medical purposes."

    "title": "Antibiotic Resistance",
    "ques": "How can overuse of antibiotics lead to antibiotic resistance in bacteria?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Overuse of antibiotics kills susceptible bacteria but allows resistant ones to survive and multiply, leading to strains that no longer respond to common treatments."
    },
    "explanation": "When antibiotics are used too often or incorrectly, ***natural selection*** favors bacteria with resistance genes.\n\nThese bacteria survive, reproduce, and pass on resistance traits (e.g., via ```plasmids```).\n\nResult: Common infections become harder to treat and require stronger or multiple drugs."

    "ques": "What are induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and how are they created?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "iPSCs are adult cells reprogrammed to behave like embryonic stem cells by introducing specific genes that reset their state."
    },
    "explanation": "***iPSCs*** are made by inserting a set of regulatory genes into adult cells (e.g., skin cells).\n\nThese genes (e.g., ***Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc***) reset the cellâ€™s function and make it ***pluripotent***â€”capable of becoming any cell type.\n\niPSCs are used in research and therapy without the ethical issues of embryonic stem cells."
