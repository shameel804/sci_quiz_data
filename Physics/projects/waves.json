    "explanation": "***When the observer moves away from a stationary source***:\nUse: ```f' = f × (v - vo) / v```\nGiven:\n```f = 400 Hz```, ```vo = 10 m/s```, ```v = 340 m/s```\nSubstitute:\n```f' = 400 × 330 / 340 ≈ 388.24 Hz```\nSo, the ***observed frequency is approximately 388.24 Hz***."

    "ques": "A coin lies at the bottom of a water tank 40 cm deep. If the refractive index of water is 1.33, what is the apparent depth of the coin?",
    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Apparent depth = Real depth / Refractive index\n= 40 / 1.33 ≈ 30.08 cm"
    },
    "explanation": "***Apparent depth is given by: Apparent = Real / n***\nGiven:\n```Real depth = 40 cm```, ```n = 1.33```\n```Apparent depth = 40 / 1.33 ≈ 30.08 cm```\nSo, the ***coin appears to be at a depth of 30.08 cm from the surface***."

    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Fringe width β ∝ λ\nNew width = (600 / 500) × original width = 1.2 × original width"
    },
    "explanation": "***Fringe width (β) is directly proportional to wavelength (λ)***:\n```β ∝ λ```\nSo, if:\n```λ increases from 500 nm to 600 nm```,\n```New β = (600 / 500) × original = 1.2 × original```\nThe ***fringe width increases by 20%***."
