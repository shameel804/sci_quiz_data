        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Transit method:** Planet passes in front of star → small dip in brightness\n\n**2. Learn:**\n- Planet size (depth of dip)\n- Orbital period (time between transits)\n- Atmosphere composition (transmission spectroscopy)\n\n**3. Limitations:**\n- Requires orbital plane alignment\n- Favors close-in planets\n- False positives (eclipsing binaries)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Kepler mission** discovered thousands of exoplanets using transits. ~0.5% dip for Jupiter-size planet."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Radial velocity:** Detect star's wobble from orbiting planet via Doppler shift\n\n**2. Wobble:** Planet and star orbit common center of mass → star moves slightly\n\n**3. Measure:**\n- Minimum planet mass\n- Orbital period\n- Eccentricity\n- Cannot get true mass (inclination unknown)"
        },
        "explanation": "**First exoplanets** were found this way (51 Pegasi b, 1995). Sensitive to massive, close planets."

            "content": "**1. Habitable zone:** Region where liquid water could exist on planet surface\n\n**2. Determined by:**\n- Star's luminosity\n- Planet's distance\n- Also: atmosphere, albedo, greenhouse effect\n\n**3. Not guaranteed:**\n- Need atmosphere\n- Right composition\n- Stable conditions\n- Mars is in HZ but dry"
        },
        "explanation": "**Goldiloads zone** is just first step. Many factors affect habitability."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Hot Jupiters:** Gas giants very close to star (orbital period < 10 days)\n\n**2. Unexpected:** Too hot to form there (ices can't condense) → challenged planet formation theory\n\n**3. Formation theories:**\n- Formed far out, migrated inward\n- Disk migration (drag from gas disk)\n- Gravitational scattering then circularization"
        },
        "explanation": "**51 Pegasi b** was first hot Jupiter found. They're easiest to detect but rare (~1% of stars)."

Prospects:**\n- 3-4 in HZ\n- But: tidal locking, stellar flares\n- Being studied by JWST\n- Most promising system for biosignature search"
        },
        "explanation": "**TRAPPIST-1** is only 40 light-years away. All 7 planets would fit inside Mercury's orbit!"
