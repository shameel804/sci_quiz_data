        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**4 Steps:**\n1. Variation exists in population\n2. Some variations are heritable\n3. More offspring than can survive\n4. Favorable traits increase in frequency\n\n**Peppered moths:** Before industrial revolution, light moths common. Pollution darkened trees → dark moths survived better → dark moths became common"
        },
        "explanation": "**Natural selection** is the mechanism of evolution. Environment 'selects' individuals with advantageous traits."

        "title": "Evidence for Evolution 🦴",
        "ques": "Explain these types of evidence:\n1. Fossil evidence\n2. Homologous structures\n3. Vestigial structures",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Fossils:** Show transitional forms (e.g., Archaeopteryx - dinosaur→bird)\n\n**2. Homologous structures:** Same bone structure, different function (arm, wing, flipper) → common ancestor\n\n**3. Vestigial structures:** Reduced organs with no function (human appendix, whale hip bones) → had function in ancestors"
        },
        "explanation": "**Multiple lines of evidence** support evolution: fossils, anatomy, embryology, molecular biology."

        "ques": "1. What is speciation?\n2. Explain allopatric vs sympatric\n3. What is reproductive isolation?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Speciation:** Formation of new species\n\n**2. Types:**\n- Allopatric: Geographic barrier separates populations\n- Sympatric: Speciation in same area (polyploidy, habitat specialization)\n\n**3. Reproductive isolation:** Cannot interbreed and produce fertile offspring (defines species)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Speciation** requires reproductive isolation. Geographic barriers often start the process by preventing gene flow."

        "ques": "1. What is genetic drift?\n2. Explain bottleneck effect\n3. Explain founder effect",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Genetic drift:** Random changes in allele frequency, especially in small populations\n\n**2. Bottleneck:** Population crash reduces genetic diversity (cheetahs)\n\n**3. Founder effect:** Small group colonizes new area → limited genetic diversity (Amish communities)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Genetic drift** is evolution by chance, not selection. It's stronger in small populations."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Correct order:**\n1. Australopithecus (~4 mya) - bipedal, small brain\n2. Homo erectus (~1.9 mya) - larger brain, used fire\n3. Homo sapiens (~300 kya) - modern humans\n\n**Key traits:** Bipedalism → tool use → larger brain → language"
        },
        "explanation": "**Human evolution** shows gradual development of key traits. We share 98% of DNA with chimpanzees."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Camouflage** → Structural adaptation (body structure)\n\n**2. Migration** → Behavioral adaptation (actions)\n\n**3. Thick fur** → Structural adaptation (insulation)"
        },
        "explanation": "**Adaptations** help organisms survive. They can be structural, behavioral, or physiological (internal processes)."
