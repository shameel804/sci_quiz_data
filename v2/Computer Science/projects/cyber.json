            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Symmetric Encryption:**\n- Same key to encrypt/decrypt\n- Fast, efficient\n- Problem: Key distribution\n- *Examples:* AES, DES, ChaCha20\n\n**Asymmetric Encryption:**\n- Public key encrypts, private key decrypts\n- Slower, more secure key exchange\n- *Examples:* RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman\n\n**Hybrid Approach (TLS/HTTPS):**\n1. Asymmetric to exchange symmetric key\n2. Symmetric for actual data encryption"

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Hashing vs Encrypting:**\n- **Encryption:** Reversible (need key)\n- **Hashing:** One-way function (can't reverse)\n\n**Why Hash Passwords:**\n- Even if database leaked, passwords safe\n- Server doesn't need to know password\n- Just compare hashes\n\n**Salting:**\n- Add random data before hashing\n- Prevents rainbow table attacks\n- Each user has unique salt\n\n**Good Algorithms:** bcrypt, Argon2, scrypt"
