            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Definitions:**\n- Systematic study of natural world\n- Knowledge gained through observation/experiment\n- Self-correcting process\n\n**2. Science vs pseudoscience:**\n- Science: Testable, falsifiable, peer-reviewed\n- Pseudoscience: Unfalsifiable, cherry-picked evidence, no progress\n- Examples: astrology, homeopathy\n\n**3. Demarcation problem:**\n- Difficult to draw clear line\n- Popper: Falsifiability criterion\n- Some legitimate science is speculative\n- Context matters"
        },
        "explanation": "**Pseudoscience** mimics science superficially but lacks rigorous methodology."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Complexity:**\n- Aims for objectivity\n- Scientists have biases\n- Methods reduce (not eliminate) bias\n- Reproducibility helps\n\n**2. Values in science:**\n- What to study (funding, interest)\n- How to interpret ambiguous results\n- Risk/benefit assessments\n- Cannot be \"value-free\"\n\n**3. Social construction:**\n- Scientific knowledge influenced by society\n- But constrained by reality\n- Moderate view: socially situated realism"
        },
        "explanation": "**Scientific consensus** emerges from imperfect humans but is still our best approximation of truth."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Realism:** Scientific theories describe reality\n- Atoms, electrons exist\n- Science discovers truth\n\n**2. Antirealism arguments:**\n- Underdetermination (multiple theories fit data)\n- Pessimistic induction (past \"true\" theories abandoned)\n- Instrumentalism: Theories are tools, not descriptions\n\n**3. Why it matters:**\n- What does science tell us about reality?\n- Implications for policy\n- Understanding science's claims"

Types:**\n- Physical (ball-and-stick molecules)\n- Mathematical (equations)\n- Computational (simulations)\n- Conceptual (diagrams)\n\n**3. Truth status:**\n- Not literally true\n- Useful approximations\n- Multiple models for same phenomenon\n- Judge by usefulness, not truth"

        "explanation": "**\"All models are wrong, but some are useful\"** - George Box. Science uses models strategically."

            "content": "**1. Correlation ≠ Causation:**\n- Ice cream and drowning both increase in summer\n- Doesn't mean ice cream causes drowning\n- Third variable (hot weather)\n\n**2. Explanation types:**\n- Causal/mechanical\n- Functional (purpose)\n- Unification (common principles)\n\n**3. Establishing causation:**\n- Temporal precedence\n- Plausible mechanism\n- Controlled experiments\n- Dose-response relationship\n- Ruling out alternatives"

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Most say yes:**\n- We can do more now\n- Better predictions\n- More understanding\n- Some disagree (Kuhn: different, not better)\n\n**2. Measuring progress:**\n- Predictive accuracy\n- Explanatory power\n- Practical applications\n- Problem-solving ability\n\n**3. Later theories:**\n- Generally more accurate in domains tested\n- Einstein didn't prove Newton \"wrong\"\n- Approximate truth gets closer\n- But paradigm shifts can redefine \"progress\""

        "explanation": "**Science accumulates knowledge** but isn't a simple linear march. Revolutionary periods disrupt."
