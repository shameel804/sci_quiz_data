            "content": "**1. Definition:** Benefits humans receive from ecosystems\n\n**2. Categories:**\n- Provisioning: Food, water, timber\n- Regulating: Climate, flood control, pollination\n- Cultural: Recreation, spiritual, aesthetic\n- Supporting: Nutrient cycling, soil formation\n\n**3. Valuation methods:**\n- Market prices (timber, fish)\n- Replacement cost (artificial pollination)\n- Contingent valuation (surveys)\n- Avoided cost (flood protection)"

            "content": "**1. Carrying capacity (K):** Maximum population environment can sustain indefinitely\n\n**2. Reproductive strategies:**\n- r-selected: Many offspring, little care (insects, fish)\n- K-selected: Few offspring, much care (elephants, humans)\n\n**3. Growth models:**\n- Exponential: dN/dt = rN (unlimited resources)\n- Logistic: dN/dt = rN(1-N/K) (limited resources)"
