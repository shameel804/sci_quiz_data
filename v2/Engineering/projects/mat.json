        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Yield strength:** Stress at which material begins to deform permanently\n\n**2. Deformation types:**\n- Elastic: Returns to original shape when stress removed\n- Plastic: Permanent deformation remains\n\n**3. Hardness:** Resistance to indentation/scratching\n- Measured by Brinell, Rockwell, Vickers tests"
        },
        "explanation": "**Stress-strain curve** shows material behavior. Area under curve = toughness (energy to fracture)."

            "content": "**1. Corrosion:** Degradation of metal by chemical/electrochemical reaction with environment\n\n**2. Types:**\n- Uniform (rust)\n- Galvanic (dissimilar metals)\n- Pitting (localized)\n- Crevice (in gaps)\n- Stress corrosion cracking\n\n**3. Prevention:**\n- Protective coatings (paint, plating)\n- Cathodic protection\n- Corrosion-resistant alloys\n- Control environment"
        },
        "explanation": "**Galvanic series** predicts which metal corrodes when two contact. More active = more corrosion."

        "ques": "1. What is annealing?\n2. What is quenching?\n3. What is tempering?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Annealing:** Heat to high temp, cool slowly\n- Effect: Softens metal, relieves stress, increases ductility\n\n**2. Quenching:** Heat then rapid cool (water/oil)\n- Effect: Hardens metal (martensite formation in steel)\n\n**3. Tempering:** Reheat quenched steel to moderate temp\n- Effect: Reduces brittleness while maintaining hardness"
        },
        "explanation": "**Heat treatment** alters microstructure. Quench hardening + tempering is common for tools."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**1. Composite:** Two or more materials combined for improved properties\n- Matrix + Reinforcement\n\n**2. Examples:**\n- Fiberglass (glass fibers + polymer)\n- Carbon fiber (carbon + epoxy)\n- Concrete (cement + aggregate)\n- Plywood (wood layers)\n\n**3. Advantages:**\n- High strength-to-weight ratio\n- Corrosion resistance\n- Tailored properties\n- Design flexibility"

            "content": "**1. Polymer:** Large molecules made of repeating units (monomers)\n\n**2. Types:**\n- Thermoplastic: Soften when heated, can remold (recyclable)\n- Thermoset: Permanent shape after curing (not recyclable)\n\n**3. Common polymers:**\n- PE (polyethylene): Bags, bottles\n- PP (polypropylene): Containers, fibers\n- PVC: Pipes, cables\n- HDPE/LDPE: Varying densities"

Ashby chart:** Plot of two properties (e.g., strength vs density) showing material families\n\n**3. Trade-off example:**\nAircraft: Need high strength, low weight\n- Steel: Strong but heavy\n- Aluminum: Lighter, adequate strength\n- Carbon fiber: Best ratio, most expensive"
        },
        "explanation": "**Ashby selection method** systematically narrows choices. No perfect material - always trade-offs."
