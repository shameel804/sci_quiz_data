Here's what you've mastered:\n\n## The Four Laws\n\n| Law | Statement |\n|-----|-----------|\n| **0th** | Thermal equilibrium is transitive |\n| **1st** | Energy is conserved: ΔU = Q - W |\n| **2nd** | Entropy always increases |\n| **3rd** | Absolute zero is unattainable |\n\n## Heat Transfer Mechanisms\n\n| Method | Mechanism | Medium |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| **Conduction** | Molecular collisions | Solids |\n| **Convection** | Bulk fluid motion | Fluids |\n| **Radiation** | EM waves | No medium needed |\n\n## Key Equations\n\n- Heat: **Q = mcΔT**\n- Conduction: **Q/t = kAΔT/L**\n- Radiation: **P = εσAT⁴**\n- Linear expansion: **ΔL = αL₀ΔT**\n- Carnot efficiency: **η = 1 - T_C/T_H**\n\n## Engines & Refrigerators\n\n- Engines convert heat to work (η < 100%)\n- Refrigerators use work to move heat (COP > 1 possible)\n- Carnot cycle gives theoretical maximum performance\n\n## Entropy\n\n- Measures disorder\n- Always increases in isolated systems\n- Defines the arrow of time\n\n> 🚀 **Next Steps:** Apply thermodynamics to Electromagnetism and understand how electromagnetic energy transfers work!\n\nYou're now equipped to analyze any thermal system!"
