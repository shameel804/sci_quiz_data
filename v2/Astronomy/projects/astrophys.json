Types:**\n- Stellar: 3-10 M☉ (from star collapse)\n- Intermediate: 100-10,000 M☉\n- Supermassive: millions-billions M☉ (galaxy centers)\n\n**3. Escape:** Nothing escapes once inside. Hawking radiation slowly evaporates black holes (theoretically)."

            "content": "**1. Types:**\n- Special: Deals with constant velocity (time dilation, length contraction)\n- General: Includes gravity = curved spacetime\n\n**2. GPS:** Satellites experience both effects; clocks run faster (weaker gravity) and slower (high speed) → net correction needed\n\n**3. Gravitational time dilation:** Clocks run slower in stronger gravity (near massive objects)"
