      "type": "text",
      "content": "Electronegativity increases across a period due to increasing nuclear charge.\nIt decreases down a group due to increasing atomic size and shielding effect."
    },
    "explanation": "***Electronegativity*** refers to the ability of an atom to attract shared electrons.\nAcross a period, ***nuclear charge increases*** but the shielding effect remains almost the same.\nThis causes the valence electrons to be pulled closer to the nucleus, increasing ***electronegativity***.\nDown a group, although nuclear charge increases, ***atomic radius increases significantly***.\nThis is due to the addition of shells, causing greater ***electron shielding***.\nAs a result, the ability to attract electrons decreases, lowering ***electronegativity***."

      "content": "Nonmetal oxides react with water to form acids.\nFor example, CO2 forms carbonic acid and SO2 forms sulfurous acid."
    },

    "answer": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Boron has a lower ionization energy than beryllium because its outer electron is in a 2p orbital, which is higher in energy and less tightly held than the 2s electron in beryllium."

    "explanation": "Beryllium: ***1s² 2s²*** → Outer electron in ***2s orbital***\nBoron: ***1s² 2s² 2p¹*** → Outer electron in ***2p orbital***\n***2p orbitals are higher in energy*** and more shielded than 2s.\nThus, it is ***easier to remove*** the 2p electron from boron.\nSo, ***ionization energy of boron is lower than beryllium***, even though it lies to the right."
