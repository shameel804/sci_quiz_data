            "content": "**1.** Large sections of Earth's lithosphere that move on asthenosphere\n\n**2. Boundaries:**\n- Divergent: Plates move apart (mid-ocean ridges)\n- Convergent: Plates collide (mountains, trenches)\n- Transform: Plates slide past (earthquakes)\n\n**3. Drivers:**\n- Mantle convection\n- Ridge push\n- Slab pull"

            "content": "**1. Types:**\n- Shield: Low viscosity, gentle slopes (Hawaii)\n- Composite/Stratovolcano: Explosive, steep (Mt. Fuji)\n- Cinder cone: Small, steep, short-lived\n\n**2. Form because:**\n- Divergent: Magma rises as plates separate\n- Convergent: Subducting plate melts, magma rises\n\n**3. Ring of Fire:** Pacific Ocean rim with 75% of world's volcanoes"
        },
        "explanation": "**Magma viscosity** determines eruption style. High silica = explosive; low silica = flowing."
