            "content": "**1. Types:**\n- Symmetric: Same key encrypts/decrypts (faster)\n- Asymmetric: Public/private key pair (more secure)\n\n**2. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):**\n- Symmetric encryption\n- 128, 192, or 256-bit keys\n- Used for data at rest\n\n**3. RSA:**\n- Asymmetric encryption\n- Based on factoring large primes\n- Public key encrypts, private key decrypts"
